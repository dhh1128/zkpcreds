This repo contains information about [W3C verifiable credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) that [use zero-knowledge proofs to achieve privacy](https://www.evernym.com/blog/categorizing-verifiable-credentials/#correlation). This is the [type of credentials](https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/AnonCred-RWC.pdf) used in the [Sovrin ecosystem](https://sovrin.org), and is similar to approaches introduced with [ABC4Trust](https://www.abc4trust.eu/) and [Idemix from IBM Research](https://idemix.wordpress.com/).

Professional cryptographers believe that the privacy offered by such credentials is useful and trustworthy. However, people behind other credential technologies have raised FUD. This is a place to gather and publish material on the topic, for public edification. As a whole, the repo is a personal project; however, specific artifacts may be endorsed or sponsored by the Sovrin Foundation (where I am a member of the Technical Governance Board) or by Evernym (where I work).
